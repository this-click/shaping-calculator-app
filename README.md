# Shaping Calculator App

An work in progress app to help shape my knitting projects.

Based on Roxanne Richardson's spreadsheet, this app supports my hobby and demonstrates data persistence using Room library.

TODOs:
1. Display a toast after adding new items
2. Finish implementing the right formula
3. Fix: cards not refreshed with new values, after entering different values in Edit Texts
4. Display placeholder while data is loaded from DB so user doesn't see the string templates
