An app to help shape my knitting projects.

Based on Roxanne Richardson's spreadsheet, this app supports my hobby and demonstrates data persistance using Room library.

TODOs:
1. Display last saved values in DB, if any, when opening app
2. Display a toast after adding new items
3. Replace hardcoded results with actual calculations
