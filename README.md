An work in progress app to help shape my knitting projects.

Based on Roxanne Richardson's spreadsheet, this app supports my hobby and demonstrates data persistence using Room library.

TODOs:
1. Display a toast after adding new items
2. Implement refresh data after entering new values and tapping Calculate
3. Display placeholder while data is loaded from DB so user doesn't see the string templates
